NAME
    Net::MovableType - light-weight MovableType client

SYNOPSIS
      use Net::MovableType;
      my $mt = new Net::MovableType($rsd_file_or_url, $username, $password);
      my $entries = $mt->getRecentPosts(5);
      while ( my $entry = shift @$entries ) {
        printf("[%02d] - %s\n\tURI: %s\n",
           $entry->{postid}, $entry->{title}, $entry->{'link'} )
      }

DESCRIPTION
    Using *Net::MovableType* you can post new entries, edit existing
    entries, browse entries and users blogs, and perform most of the
    features you can perform through accessing your MovableType account.

    Since *Net::MovableType* uses MT's *remote procedure call* gateway, you
    can do it from any computer with Internet connection.
